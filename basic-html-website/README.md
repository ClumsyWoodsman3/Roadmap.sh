- Link this tutorial on [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-html-website)
<p>Goal of this project is to teach you how to structure a website using HTML i.e. different sections of a website like header, footer, navigation, main content, sidebars etc. Do not style the website, only focus on the structure. Styling will be done in separate projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this project, you are required to create a simple HTML only website with multiple pages. The website should have following pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Homepage</li>
<li>Projects</li>
<li>Articles</li>
<li>Contact</li>
</ul>
<p>The website should have a navigation bar that should be present on all pages and link to all the pages.</p>
<p>You are not required to style the website, you are only required to create the structure of the website using HTML. Goals of this project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn how to create multiple pages in a website.</li>
<li>Structure a website using HTML in a semantic way.</li>
<li>Structure in a way that you can easily add styles later.</li>
<li>Add SEO meta tags to the website.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the following mockup example to create the structure of the website (remember, you are not required to style the website, only focus on the structure that you can style later):</p>
